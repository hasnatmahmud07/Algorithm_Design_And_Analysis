This repository contains two fundamental searching algorithms implemented in C++:

Linear Search: Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element of the array one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends.
      
              🔹How linear search works -

                    i. Start from the first element.
                    ii. Compare each element with the target value.
                    iii. If found, return the index.
                    iv. If not found after checking all elements, return "Not Found".

🔹 Time Complexity
      - Best Case: O(1)
      - Worst Case: O(n)

🔹 Suitable For
   - Small datasets
   - Unsorted arrays
2. Binary Search: Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works only on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval into halves.
🔹 How binary search works -
      i. Find the middle element.
      ii. If the target equals the middle element → Found.
      iii. If target is smaller → Search left half.
      iv. If target is larger → Search right half.
      v. Repeat until found or interval becomes empty.
🔹 Time Complexity
     - Best Case: O(1)
     - Worst Case: O(log n)
🔹 Suitable For
      - Large datasets
      - Sorted arrays
